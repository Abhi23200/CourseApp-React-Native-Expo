# CodingCourse_APP React Native Expo


Setting Up Expo and Creating a New Project:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
Install Expo CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

npm install -g expo-cli

Expo will automatically handle the installation and link the necessary dependencies.
Upgrading Expo:

To upgrade Expo to the latest version, run the following command in your project directory:
expo upgrade


Follow the prompts to upgrade your project to the latest compatible Expo version.
Installing Dependencies from Package.json:

When you create a new project using Expo CLI, a "package.json" file is automatically generated with the initial dependencies.
To install all the dependencies listed in the "package.json" file, run the following command in your project directory:

npm install

This will install all the required packages specified in the "dependencies" and "devDependencies" sections of the "package.json" file.

ThankYou Developers.
